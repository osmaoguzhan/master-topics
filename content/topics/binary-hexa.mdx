## Binary Number System:

The binary number system uses a base of 2 and consists of two digits: 0 and 1. In this system, each digit's value represents a power of 2 based on its position. For example, the binary number 1010 represents (1 _ 2^3) + (0 _ 2^2) + (1 _ 2^1) + (0 _ 2^0) = 10 in decimal. Computers extensively use the binary system internally for data processing, storage, and logical operations due to the ease of electronic implementation.

## Hexadecimal Number System:

The hexadecimal number system uses a base of 16 and consists of digits from 0 to 9 and letters from A to F, representing values from 0 to 15. Hexadecimal digits can represent four binary digits (bits) compactly. For example, the hexadecimal digit A represents the binary value 1010. Hexadecimal numbers are commonly used in computer science and programming to represent memory addresses, color codes, and binary data. They provide a more compact representation compared to binary and are easier to read and manipulate.
