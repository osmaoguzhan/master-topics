# Elementary Search Methods and Hash-based Search

Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. Based on the type of search operation, these elementary algorithms are generally classified into two categories:

1. **Sequential Search:** In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: Linear Search.

- **_Linear Search:_** Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. It is the easiest searching algorithm.

2. **Interval Search:** These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For example: Binary Search.

- **_Binary Search:_** Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity.

### Advanced Searching Algorithms

1. **Hash-based Search**:
   Hashing is a popular technique for storing and retrieving data as fast as possible. The main reason behind using hashing is that it gives optimal results as it performs optimal searches.

#### Hashing Components:

1. **Hash Table:** An array that stores pointers to records corresponding to a given number. Hash table gives the functionality in which a collection of data is stored in such a way that it is easy to find those items later if required. This makes searching of an element very efficient.
2. **Hash Function:** A function that is used to transform a given key into a specific slot index. Its main job is to map each and every possible key into a unique slot index. If every key is mapped into a unique slot index, then the hash function is known as a perfect hash function.
3. **Collision Handling:** Since a hash function gets us a small number for a big key, there is possibility that two keys result in same value. The situation where a newly inserted key maps to an already occupied slot in hash table is called collision and must be handled using some collision handling technique.

# Example Questions

1. **What are elementary search methods in algorithms?**
   Elementary search methods, also known as sequential search methods, are basic algorithms used to search for a specific element in a collection of data. They typically involve examining each element one by one until a match is found or the end of the collection is reached.

2. **What are some examples of elementary search methods?**
   Examples of elementary search methods include linear search, binary search, and sentinel search. Linear search checks each element in a linear manner, while binary search is applicable to sorted arrays and uses a divide-and-conquer approach. Sentinel search uses a special value as a marker to improve performance.

3. **What is hash-based search?**
   Hash-based search is a technique that uses a hash function to map keys to specific locations in a data structure called a hash table. It allows for efficient retrieval of values associated with keys by reducing the search space and providing constant-time (O(1)) average case search complexity.

4. **What is a hash table?**
   A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It utilizes a hash function to compute an index or bucket for each key, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations. Hash tables are widely used in various applications due to their fast access times.

5. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of hash-based search?**
   Hash-based search offers fast average case search time, making it ideal for large datasets. It provides constant-time complexity for search operations. However, it may suffer from collisions, where multiple keys map to the same index, leading to longer search times. Collision resolution techniques, such as chaining or open addressing, are used to handle collisions effectively.
