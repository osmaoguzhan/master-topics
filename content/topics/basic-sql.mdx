# Basic SQL Language Constructions

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a set of constructs that allow users to query and manipulate data stored in a database. Here are some of the basic SQL language constructions:

## 1. SELECT Statement

The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from one or more database tables. It has the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

You can specify the columns you want to retrieve from the table(s) and the table(s) from which you want to retrieve the data.

## 2. WHERE Clause

The WHERE clause is used to filter rows based on specified conditions. It follows the SELECT statement and has the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

The condition specifies the criteria that the rows must meet to be included in the result set.

## 3. INSERT Statement

The INSERT statement is used to insert new rows into a table. It has the following syntax:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

You specify the table into which you want to insert the data and provide the values for the corresponding columns.

## 4. UPDATE Statement

The UPDATE statement is used to update existing rows in a table. It has the following syntax:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

You specify the table you want to update and provide the new values for the corresponding columns. The condition specifies the criteria that the rows must meet to be updated.

## 5. DELETE Statement

The DELETE statement is used to delete existing rows from a table. It has the following syntax:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

You specify the table from which you want to delete the rows. The condition specifies the criteria that the rows must meet to be deleted.

## 6. ORDER BY Clause

The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set by one or more columns. It follows the SELECT statement and has the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
```

You specify the columns by which you want to sort the result set and the sort order (ascending or descending).

## 7. GROUP BY Clause

The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in one or more columns. It follows the SELECT statement and has the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...;
```

You specify the columns by which you want to group the rows.

## 8. HAVING Clause

The HAVING clause is used to filter groups based on specified conditions. It follows the GROUP BY clause and has the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...
HAVING condition;
```

The condition specifies the criteria that the groups must meet to be included in the result set.

## 9. JOIN Clause

The JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a common column. It follows the FROM clause and has the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

You specify the tables you want to join and the common column.

## 10. UNION Clause

The UNION clause is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements. It has the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

You specify the SELECT statements whose result sets you want to combine.

## 11. CREATE TABLE Statement

The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table. It has the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column1 datatype,
  column2 datatype,
  ...
);
```

You specify the table name and the columns that the table will have.

## 12. ALTER TABLE Statement

The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, modify, or drop columns in an existing table. It has the following syntax:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;
```

You specify the table name and the column you want to add.

## 13. DROP TABLE Statement

The DROP TABLE statement is used to delete an existing table. It has the following syntax:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

You specify the table you want to delete.
