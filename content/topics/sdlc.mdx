# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that defines the processes and stages involved in developing and maintaining software. It encompasses various phases, each with its specific objectives, deliverables, and activities. Here are the typical stages of the SDLC:

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   In this initial phase, the project team interacts with stakeholders to identify and document the software requirements. This involves understanding the needs of the end-users, business goals, and functional specifications.

2. **Analysis and Design**
   During this phase, the requirements are analyzed to create a detailed system design. The design includes architectural diagrams, database schema, user interface (UI) wireframes, and any other necessary technical specifications.

3. **Development**
   The development phase involves coding the software based on the design specifications. Programmers write the code using suitable programming languages and development frameworks. This stage also includes unit testing to ensure individual components function correctly.

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)**
   The testing phase aims to identify defects and ensure the software meets the specified requirements. Testers create and execute test cases, perform functional and non-functional testing, and report bugs or issues to the development team. Quality Assurance activities focus on ensuring the overall quality and adherence to standards.

5. **Deployment and Release**
   Once the software has passed the testing phase, it is deployed to the production environment or released to end-users. This stage involves preparing installation packages, configuring servers, and executing deployment plans to make the software available for use.

6. **Maintenance and Support**
   After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. It involves addressing user-reported issues, applying updates or patches, and making enhancements based on feedback or changing requirements. Support teams provide assistance to users, troubleshoot problems, and ensure the software remains operational.

7. **Retirement or Replacement**
   Eventually, software reaches the end of its life cycle. It may become obsolete, inefficient, or unable to meet evolving needs. At this stage, the software is either retired, meaning it's no longer supported, or replaced with a newer version or alternative solution.

These stages provide a high-level overview of the software development life cycle. However, the actual SDLC process may vary depending on the development methodology used (e.g., waterfall, Agile) or specific project requirements.

It's important to note that SDLC is a continuous process, and different stages may overlap or iterate based on the project's nature and complexity. Effective management and coordination across these stages are crucial for successful software development.
