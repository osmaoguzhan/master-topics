# Static Polymorphism - Templates

Static polymorphism is a type of polymorphism that collects the information to call a method during compile time while dynamic polymorphism is a type of polymorphism that collects information to call a method at run time. Thus, this is the main difference between static and dynamic polymorphism.

Example:

```java
public class Example<T> {
    private T value;

    public Example(T value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public T getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example<Integer> intExample = new Example<>(10);
        System.out.println("Integer value: " + intExample.getValue());

        Example<String> stringExample = new Example<>("Hello");
        System.out.println("String value: " + stringExample.getValue());
    }
}
```

# Example Questions

1. **What is static polymorphism and how is it achieved using templates?**\
   Static polymorphism, also known as compile-time polymorphism, is a programming concept where different implementations of a function or class can be used based on the compile-time types of the arguments or template parameters. It is achieved using templates in languages like C++, where generic code can be written to work with different types. During compilation, the templates are instantiated for specific types, generating specialized code for each type.

2. **What are the advantages of using static polymorphism with templates?**\
   There are several advantages of using static polymorphism with templates:

   - Code reusability: Templates allow for writing generic code that can work with different types, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.
   - Performance: Static polymorphism resolves function calls at compile-time, resulting in faster execution compared to dynamic polymorphism. There is no runtime overhead associated with virtual function dispatch.
   - Strong type checking: Templates enforce type safety at compile-time, preventing type-related errors. The compiler performs type checking during template instantiation, reducing the risk of runtime errors.

3. **How does static polymorphism using templates differ from dynamic polymorphism?**\
   Static polymorphism using templates differs from dynamic polymorphism in the following ways:
   - Resolution time: Static polymorphism resolves function calls at compile-time, while dynamic polymorphism resolves them at runtime.
   - Performance: Static polymorphism has better runtime performance since there is no overhead associated with virtual function dispatch. Dynamic polymorphism involves vtable lookup and virtual function dispatch, which can impact performance.
   - Flexibility: Static polymorphism using templates provides flexibility to write generic code that works with different types. Dynamic polymorphism relies on inheritance and virtual functions to achieve runtime polymorphism.
