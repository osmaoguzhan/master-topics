# Matrices: Basic Operations, Rank, and Determinant

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or elements arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering, to represent and manipulate sets of data or mathematical equations.

## Matrix Representation

A matrix is typically denoted by a capital letter and defined by its dimensions, indicating the number of rows and columns. For example, an "m x n" matrix has "m" rows and "n" columns. The elements of a matrix are usually represented by lowercase letters with subscripts indicating their position in the matrix.

### Example:

Let's consider the matrix A:

```
A = [[1, 2, 3],
     [4, 5, 6],
     [7, 8, 9]]
```

This is a 3x3 matrix, with 3 rows and 3 columns. The element at position (2, 3) is denoted as A<sub>2,3</sub> and has the value 6.

## Basic Matrix Operations

1. **Matrix Addition:** Addition of matrices is performed by adding corresponding elements. For two matrices to be added, they must have the same dimensions.

   ### Example:

   Let's consider two matrices A and B:

   ```
   A = [[1, 2],
        [3, 4]]

   B = [[5, 6],
        [7, 8]]
   ```

   The result of adding A and B is:

   ```
   A + B = [[1+5, 2+6],
            [3+7, 4+8]] = [[6, 8],
                            [10, 12]]
   ```

2. **Matrix Subtraction:** Subtraction of matrices is performed by subtracting corresponding elements. Like addition, the matrices must have the same dimensions.

   ### Example:

   Let's consider two matrices C and D:

   ```
   C = [[1, 2],
        [3, 4]]

   D = [[5, 6],
        [7, 8]]
   ```

   The result of subtracting D from C is:

   ```
   C - D = [[1-5, 2-6],
            [3-7, 4-8]] = [[-4, -4],
                            [-4, -4]]
   ```

3. **Scalar Multiplication:** Scalar multiplication involves multiplying a matrix by a scalar (a single number). Each element of the matrix is multiplied by the scalar.

   ### Example:

   Let's consider a matrix E:

   ```
   E = [[1, 2],
        [3, 4]]
   ```

   If we multiply E by a scalar value of 2, the result is:

   ```
   2E = [[2*1, 2*2],
         [2*3, 2*4]] = [[2, 4],
                         [6, 8]]
   ```

4. **Matrix Multiplication:** Matrix multiplication is a more complex operation. It involves multiplying the elements of one matrix by the elements of another matrix and summing the results. Matrix multiplication is only defined when the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.

   ### Example:

   Let's consider two matrices F and G:

```
   F = [[1, 2],
        [3, 4]]

   G = [[5, 6],
        [7, 8]]

```

The result of multiplying F and G is:

```

FG = [[(1*5)+(2*7), (1*6)+(2*8)],
      [(3*5)+(4*7), (3*6)+(4*8)]] = [[19, 22],
                                     [43, 50]]

```

## Rank of a Matrix

The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix. It provides information about the dimensionality and properties of the matrix.

### Example:

Let's consider a matrix H:

```

H = [[1, 2, 3],
     [4, 5, 6],
     [7, 8, 9]]

```

The rank of matrix H is 2, indicating that there are two linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix.

## Determinant of a Matrix

The determinant is a scalar value that is calculated from the elements of a square matrix. It provides important information about the matrix, such as whether it is invertible or singular.

### Example:

Let's consider a matrix I:

```

I = [[3, 1],
     [2, 4]]

```

The determinant of matrix I can be calculated as:

```

det(I) = (3*4) - (1*2) = 12 - 2 = 10

```

The determinant of matrix I is 10.
