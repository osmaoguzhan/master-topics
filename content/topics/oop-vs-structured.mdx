# Comparison: Object-Oriented Programming vs Structured Programming

## Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects that contain both data and methods to manipulate that data. It revolves around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. OOP emphasizes code reusability, modularity, and encapsulation.

Example code snippet in Python:

```python
# Class definition

class Rectangle:
def **init**(self, width, height):
self.width = width
self.height = height

    def calculate_area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

# Object creation

rect = Rectangle(5, 3)

# Method invocation

area = rect.calculate_area()
print("Area:", area)
```

## Structured Programming

Structured Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable functions or procedures. It focuses on breaking down a problem into smaller modules and uses control structures like loops and conditionals to manage program flow. Structured programming emphasizes top-down design and procedural abstraction.

Example code snippet in C:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

// Function definition
int calculateSum(int num1, int num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 3;

    // Function call
    int sum = calculateSum(a, b);
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

# Example Questions

1. **What is the main difference between Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Structured Programming?**\
   The main difference between OOP and Structured Programming is the way they organize and structure code. OOP focuses on creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior, allowing for modularity, code reuse, and easier maintenance. On the other hand, Structured Programming uses functions and procedures to organize code, emphasizing procedural abstraction and breaking down the program into smaller, manageable components.

2. **How does Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) promote code reusability?**\
   OOP promotes code reusability through the concept of inheritance. Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, forming a hierarchical relationship. By creating a base class with common attributes and methods, derived classes can inherit and extend those features, reducing code duplication. This enables developers to reuse existing code and build upon it, resulting in more efficient and modular software development.

3. **What are the advantages of using Structured Programming?**\
   Structured Programming offers several advantages. Firstly, it promotes code readability and maintainability by breaking down the program into smaller, manageable procedures or functions. This makes it easier to understand and modify the code. Secondly, Structured Programming emphasizes procedural abstraction, allowing developers to focus on specific tasks without worrying about the implementation details. Lastly, Structured Programming encourages code reusability through the use of functions, enabling developers to reuse code across different parts of the program.
