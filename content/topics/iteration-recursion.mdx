# Iteration and Recursion

In programming, iteration and recursion are two commonly used techniques for solving problems and implementing algorithms. Both approaches involve repeatedly executing a set of instructions, but they differ in how they control the flow of execution.

## Iteration

Iteration is a process of repeatedly executing a block of code until a certain condition is met. It involves using loops, such as for loops, while loops, or do-while loops, to iterate over a set of instructions. The loop condition determines whether the loop should continue or terminate.

Iterative algorithms are often used when the problem can be divided into smaller, repetitive tasks. They are typically implemented using looping constructs, which allow the program to execute a set of statements multiple times until a specific condition is satisfied.

## Recursion

Recursion is a process of solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems of the same nature. In a recursive algorithm, a function calls itself one or more times to solve a smaller instance of the problem. Each recursive call operates on a smaller input, and the results are combined to solve the original problem.

Recursive algorithms are often used when the problem can be reduced to a simpler version of the same problem. They involve defining a base case that specifies the terminating condition, and recursive cases that define how to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.

## Implementation Examples

### Iteration Example (Factorial Calculation)

```java

public int factorial(int n) {
int result = 1;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
result _= i;
}
return result;
}
```

### Recursion Example (Factorial Calculation)

```java
public int factorial(int n) {
if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
return 1;
} else {
return n _ factorial(n - 1);
}
}
```

These examples demonstrate the implementation of factorial calculation using iteration and recursion in Java. The iterative approach uses a for loop to calculate the factorial by multiplying numbers from 1 to the given input. The recursive approach breaks down the problem by calling the factorial function recursively with a smaller input until reaching the base case.

# Example Questions

1. **Explain the concept of iteration in programming and provide an example of an iterative algorithm in any programming language of your choice.**\
   Iteration is a process of repeatedly executing a block of code until a certain condition is met. It involves using loops, such as for loops, while loops, or do-while loops. These loops allow the program to execute a set of statements multiple times until a specific condition is satisfied. An example of an iterative algorithm is the calculation of the factorial of a number using a for loop in Java, as shown in the previous code snippet.

2. **Describe the concept of recursion in programming and provide an example of a recursive algorithm in any programming language of your choice.**\
   Recursion is a process of solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems of the same nature. In a recursive algorithm, a function calls itself one or more times to solve a smaller instance of the problem. Each recursive call operates on a smaller input, and the results are combined to solve the original problem. An example of a recursive algorithm is the calculation of the factorial of a number using a recursive function in Java, as shown in the previous code snippet.

3. **Compare and contrast iteration and recursion in terms of their control flow mechanisms and problem-solving approaches.**\
   Iteration and recursion are both techniques used for solving problems and implementing algorithms, but they differ in their control flow mechanisms and problem-solving approaches. Iteration uses looping constructs, such as for loops or while loops, to repeatedly execute a set of statements until a specific condition is met. It is suitable for problems that can be divided into smaller, repetitive tasks. Recursion, on the other hand, involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively by calling the same function. It relies on function calls and a termination condition (base case) to control the flow of execution. Recursion is often used for problems that can be reduced to a simpler version of the same problem.
