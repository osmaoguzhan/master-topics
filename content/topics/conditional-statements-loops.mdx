# Structured Programming: Conditional Statements and Loops

Structured programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of control structures to create clear, readable, and maintainable code. Two fundamental mechanisms of structured programming are conditional statements and loops.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements, also known as decision-making statements, allow a program to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on certain conditions. The most common conditional statements are:

- **if statement**: It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **if-else statement**: It executes one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.
- **nested if-else statement**: It allows multiple if-else statements to be nested within one another, providing more complex decision-making capabilities.
- **switch statement**: It allows the program to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of an expression.

Conditional statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program, enabling it to adapt and make decisions based on different scenarios.

## Loops

Loops are used to repeat a specific block of code until a certain condition is met. They provide a way to automate repetitive tasks and iterate over collections of data. The most commonly used loops are:

- **for loop**: It repeats a block of code a specified number of times.
- **while loop**: It repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
- **do-while loop**: It repeats a block of code at least once, and then continues to repeat as long as a specified condition is true.

Loops allow programs to process large amounts of data, perform calculations, and perform iterative operations efficiently.

Structured programming promotes the use of these control structures to create programs that are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

# Example Questions

1. **What is the purpose of a conditional statement in structured programming?**\
   A conditional statement allows a program to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on certain conditions. It controls the flow of execution and enables the program to adapt to different scenarios.

2. **What is the key difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?**\
   The key difference is that a while loop checks the condition before executing the loop block, while a do-while loop checks the condition after executing the loop block. This means that a do-while loop always executes the loop block at least once, regardless of the condition.

3. **How does a switch statement differ from an if-else statement in structured programming?**\
   A switch statement provides a way to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of an expression. It is commonly used when there are multiple possible values to check against. In contrast, an if-else statement allows for more complex conditions and decision-making based on boolean expressions.
