# Databases - Features and Types

A database is a repository of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It is organized and managed by a Database Management System (DBMS). Databases offer various features and capabilities, including:

- **Data Integrity**: The structure of the database can change without requiring changes to the applications that use the data.

- **Data Backups**: Data can be easily backed up from a single location.

- **Data Security**: Data is stored securely in a central location, and access privileges can be assigned to multiple users.

- **Data Accessibility**: Business data can be accessed by authorized personnel from any location and at any time.

- **Data Redundancy**: Redundancy or duplication of data is minimized, simplifying data management.

There are different types of databases, each serving specific purposes:

1. **Relational Databases**: Relational database technology provides efficient and flexible access to structured information.

2. **Object-oriented Databases**: Object-oriented databases represent information in the form of objects, similar to object-oriented programming.

3. **Distributed Databases**: Distributed databases are stored on multiple computers, either in the same physical location or across different networks.

4. **NoSQL Databases**: NoSQL databases allow the storage and manipulation of unstructured and semi-structured data.

5. **Graph Databases**: Graph databases are designed to work with graph data structures and are suitable for applications involving relationships and connections.

6. **OLTP Databases**: Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) databases are optimized for handling high volumes of transactional data.

7. **Cloud Databases**: Cloud databases are hosted on cloud platforms, providing scalability, availability, and ease of management.

8. **Multi-model Databases**: Multi-model databases support multiple data models, such as relational, document, graph, etc., within a single database system.

9. **Document/JSON Databases**: Document databases store and query data in JSON-like documents, providing flexibility for semi-structured data.

10. **Self-driving Databases**: Self-driving databases utilize automation and artificial intelligence to automate tasks such as tuning, optimization, and security.

These different types of databases cater to diverse data management needs and offer specific capabilities based on the nature of the data and the requirements of the applications.
