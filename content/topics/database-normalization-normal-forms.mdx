# Database Normalization - Normal Forms

Database normalization is a process in database design that helps eliminate data redundancy and improve data integrity by organizing data into well-structured tables. The normalization process involves applying a set of rules called normal forms. Here's an overview of the different normal forms:

## First Normal Form (1NF)

- Each column in a table must have a unique name.
- Each column value must be atomic (indivisible).
- There should be a primary key that uniquely identifies each row.
- There should be no repeating groups of columns.

## Second Normal Form (2NF)

- The table must satisfy all the requirements of 1NF.
- All non-key attributes must depend on the entire primary key.
- If a non-key attribute depends on only a part of the primary key, it should be moved to a separate table.

## Third Normal Form (3NF)

- The table must satisfy all the requirements of 2NF.
- There should be no transitive dependencies, where a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute.

## Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

- The table must satisfy all the requirements of 3NF.
- It must also ensure that every determinant (attribute or set of attributes) is a candidate key.

## Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

- The table must satisfy all the requirements of BCNF.
- It should prevent multi-valued dependencies, where a non-key attribute depends on a combination of attributes that form a candidate key.

## Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

- The table must satisfy all the requirements of 4NF.
- It should eliminate join dependencies, where data can be derived by joining multiple tables.

Database normalization helps in achieving data consistency, reducing data redundancy, and improving query performance. By applying the different normal forms, database designers can create efficient and well-structured database schemas.
